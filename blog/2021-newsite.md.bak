I thought that migrationg to a static site generator would be a good motivation to spend more time learning Rust ... but once I compiled Rust, and compiled Zola, everything else was just a matter of getting the templating to render well and fiddling with my build-publish workflow. Oh well. I still have a new site that I'm much happier with :)

Oh, and I copied in most, but not quite all, of my previous blog's posts.

The build-publish workflow is pretty simple, and this should be much easier to maintain than my last site:

- 'Zola' for the templating engine and site generation, with the 'Zerm' theme
- I simply edit a Markdown file for each post, maybe add some photos
- run a shell script which:
  - invokes `zola build` to render the static site
  - copies the static site into a docker container for testing
  - and copies it into another git repo that only holds the static site
- I test locally using the container, and if I like it, push the static site to GitHub Pages, which renders it at https://aeva.online/

If I wanted to migrate off of GitHub Pages, it should be trivial: I could easily run this docker image on a RasPi, for instance, or on any VM.
