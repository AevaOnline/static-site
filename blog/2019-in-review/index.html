            <p>It's been two years since I came out. So much has changed. So much has improved.</p>
<p>If 2018 was about <em>accepting</em> that truth, 2019 was about <em>taking action on it</em>..</p>
<p>For starters, I changed all my online profiles this year. I <em><a href="/blog/2019-in-review/whats-in-a-name.html">changed my name</a></em> this year.</p>
<p>I realized that my career choices over the past several years had led me uncomfortably far from my ethics. (More on that later…)</p>
<p>The result? I spent eight months of 2019 uninsured and underemployed, but still <em>very</em> busy.</p>

            
            
            
            <!-- Render the rest of the content after removing the summary portion -->
            <span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>I interviewed at dozens of tech companies … and only got one offer.</p>
<p>I burned through 😱 $30,000 😱 of savings because I kept thinking, <em>surely I’ll land the next interview!</em> I would have reorganized my life sooner, had I known I’d be without regular work for a total of 20 months.</p>
<p><strong>I underestimated how much misogyny and transphobia still rule the tech industry.</strong></p>
<p>I wrestled with an increasing understanding of a contextual, intersectional identity, and adjusted to the embrace of my gender.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, I’m trans, so what?</em> If you don’t like it, please get off this ride right now.</p>
<p>One might say, 2019 was a year of course correction.</p>
<p>I’m much more involved in things that matter to me now, and also more aware of what I will not compromise on in order to earning a living. Straddling between a day job in the tech industry and a vow I took years ago that I would work to benefit all sentient beings … continues to be a challenge in time and emotional management.</p>
<p>This means realigning my financial goals and re-prioritizing my time … but let’s look back at 2019 a little more.</p>
<h1 id="i-did-a-few-things">I did a <em>few</em> things!</h1>
<p><img src="at-defcon-2019.jpeg"
 alt="Photo of me in a leather hat with a side-pulled hairdo standing in front of a colourful sign that reads: DEFCON"
 style="float: right;" width="400" /></p>
<p>It wasn’t all just rumination and navel-gazing… I actually did a few things in 2019!</p>
<ul>
<li>started this blog</li>
<li>grew tits (heck yeah I’m proud of them!)</li>
<li>joined a podcast for my first time (that was fun!)</li>
<li>got a chapter published in a book about the intersection of the buddha-dharma &amp; my experience being trans</li>
<li>joined the Kubernetes community &amp; accepted a nomination to their Code of Conduct Committee</li>
<li>continued my role as a board member on Seattle’s local sex-positive 501(c)3</li>
<li>worked behind the scenes with the QueerCon board to improve their trans inclusivity</li>
<li>got a job at Microsoft (ikr? they’ve changed… but still… it’s weird)</li>
<li>spoke at a few conferences
<ul>
<li>ML4ALL, one of the best regional conferences I’ve ever been to. I hope it continues!</li>
<li>OpenInfra Summit. I stressed about being back after two years. After <em>transitioning</em>.</li>
<li>SeaGL, local opensource enthusiasts’ group, lotsa greybeards in the rooms</li>
<li>and IgniteSeattle was perhaps the singularly most pivotal talk experience of my career to date</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>in a rare turn of events, I attended several conferences <em>without</em> speaking at them!
<ul>
<li>WomenInCloud</li>
<li>LesbiansWhoTech</li>
<li>BSidesSF</li>
<li>DefCon</li>
<li>KubeCon</li>
<li>HushCon</li>
<li>KinkFest</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>oh, and I went on a few camping trips:
<ul>
<li>me &amp; a girlfriend in the Utah desert</li>
<li>just me in the Cascades – I had intended to do more than one solo offroad trip, but then other things happened</li>
<li>CriticalNW – it’s like camping, only with 1,500 of my closest friends!</li>
<li>BurningMan – 😂 &amp; 😭 this year as I handled the transfer and purging of all the gear from Camp Potluck. I found the yearbooks we made in 2012, ’13, and ’14, then met up &amp; shared them a few old friends …</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="i-never-feel-like-i-ve-done-enough">I never feel like I've done enough</h1>
<p>… until I look back at what I <em>have</em> done.</p>
<p>This helps me to know what I’m capable of, helps me set goals for the next cycle. It helps me overcome imposture syndrome.</p>
<p>So, about next year …</p>
<h1 id="goals-for-2020">Goals for 2020</h1>
<ul>
<li>survive the election cycle – emotional health is key. I’m continuing to reduce my consumption of social media &amp; curate where I’m creating media. be the change you want to see in the world means increasingly relying on decentralized platforms – my blog, mastodon, etc.</li>
<li>rebuild my image / brand / career – openly transitioning changed everything in ways I’m deeply grateful for, and in ways I’m still learning to see.</li>
<li>finally get that tattoo I’ve been dreaming of since 2015 😀</li>
<li>continue rebuilding my health – more camping trips, more hiking, and more routines</li>
<li>write more, on this blog and elsewhere. I’d like to publish a book of my own.</li>
<li>join more podcasts, and maybe start one. Who wants to join my podcast?</li>
<li>continue supporting and learning from younger queers in tech</li>
<li>attend less, speak more at tech conferences. I can do one a month if I reuse content, less if each talk is brand new.</li>
<li>follow through on activism that I’ve become engaged with. I see windows of opportunity that could be incredibly impactful &amp; need to keep up my energy to move on them.</li>
<li>continue building intimate partnerships</li>
</ul>
<p>Hmm… I didn’t mean for that list to be in any particular order, but apparently I put “relationship” at the bottom and maybe that’s be a bad sign? 🤷</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s all for now! ✨</p>
<p>See you in 2020</p>
