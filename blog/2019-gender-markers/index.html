      <p><em>(content warning: gender issues and gender-based violence, no specifics but still may be difficult for some)</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Yesterday, the Washington State Department of Licensing held a public hearing for comments on the proposed legislation to add an ‘X’ gender marker option on state-issued ID’s. I chose to go and stand up for all the non-binary, intersex, and transgender members of my communities.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>I was blown away by the stories that I heard, and, to be honest, a little surprised that not a single nay-sayer chose to speak up. At the very end a 16-year old high school student, who hadn’t planned to speak, bravely chose to stand up and tell their story …</p>
<p>I made it through all the other testimonies without tears, but to see a student facing the same struggle that I did as a teenager and having the language to understand it, support from adults, and the courage to speak out … Well, that student reminded me why I’m adding my voice to the chorus of change. I’m grateful for that reminder. I won’t forget it for a long time.</p>
<p>I’m also very grateful for the friends there to hold my hand while I cried, remembering the verbal and physical assaults I faced at that age – just for being different in ways that I had no context to understand.</p>
<p>One of those friends recorded my testimony, which I’ve uploaded below. Transcription follows. </p>

<pre style="background-color:#191919;color:#ffffff;"><code><span>I identified as other than the gender assigned at birth since I was
</span><span>very young, and faced discrimination, both when I was younger and as an
</span><span>adult, for that.
</span><span>
</span><span>In that time, I’ve held senior and executive positions in the tech
</span><span>industry. I’ve seen how a lack of representation, of identification,
</span><span>even in the &lt;hand wave&gt; shining example of the tech industry. It’s
</span><span>affected friends. It’s affected peers. And it’s affected me.
</span><span>
</span><span>As others have said, it also affects our ability to travel. I used to
</span><span>travel a lot for work [and] I’ve been questioned and challenged at the
</span><span>border because that border agent didn’t think I matched the gender
</span><span>marker on my documentation. I know that affects colleagues of mine.
</span><span>
</span><span>There’s one more aspect of this that is not particular to the tech
</span><span>industry, but rather affects all of industry.
</span><span>
</span><span>Because I hid that part of my identity at work for a while, I’ve seen
</span><span>how the fear of disclosure affects people. Imagine, if you will, being
</span><span>intersex or non-binary, knowing that the marker on your identification
</span><span>doesn’t match how you look or how you are, and the fear of that being
</span><span>disclosed to your employer without any legal protection. That
</span><span>potential, that fear affects people. It puts their jobs at risk, and it
</span><span>puts our companies at risk.
</span><span>
</span><span>I unambiguously support this measure so that legal documentation in our
</span><span>state accurately represents the people that work in our state. This
</span><span>will reduce the stigma and reduce discrimination for intersex and
</span><span>non-binary people.
</span><span>
</span><span>Thank you.
