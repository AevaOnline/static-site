_Rites of Passage_ have been sociologically and psychologically important to humans for, well, as long as recorded history. As someone who grew up without cultural roots (or rather, with roots in several different major world cultures) and never identified with any specific culture, I’ve often been a little jealous of folks who get to have a bar/batmitzva, a big ol’ denominational wedding, or the like. I never had those. Heck, I didn’t even have a graduation ceremony!

So a few years ago I started _making my own sacred rites_, celebrating the milestones of life in my own way. Fuck society and fuck your burn — by which I mean, ___you should make your own rules, too.___

In 2017, I threw myself an _unwedding_ (complete with a tiered cake) to mark the end of one era of my life and celebrate the formation of so many new connections to my chosen family.

2017 was also the year I started to come out. To present. _To be present_.

I wonder how I’ll look back on this day and celebrate it next year….
