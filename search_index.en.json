I chose to go and stand up for all the non-binary, intersex, and transgender members of my communities.\n\nI was blown away by the stories that I heard, and, to be honest, a little surprised that not a single nay-sayer chose to speak up. At the very end a 16-year old high school student, who hadn’t planned to speak, bravely chose to stand up and tell their story …\nI made it through all the other testimonies without tears, but to see a student facing the same struggle that I did as a teenager and having the language to understand it, support from adults, and the courage to speak out … Well, that student reminded me why I’m adding my voice to the chorus of change. I’m grateful for that reminder. I won’t forget it for a long time.\nI’m also very grateful for the friends there to hold my hand while I cried, remembering the verbal and physical assaults I faced at that age – just for being different in ways that I had no context to understand.\nOne of those friends recorded my testimony, which I’ve uploaded below. Transcription follows.\nBROKEN LINK -- https://aeva.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Dol-gender-x-testimony.mp4\n\n\n","id":"/blog/2019-gender-markers/","title":"Gender Markers"},"/blog/2019-hi-queer-trans/":{"body":"There’s something I need to get off my chest.\nI’ve used a lot of different labels to describe myself over the years – geek, goth, autodidact, polyglot, kinkster, polyamorous, third-culture kid, dharma bum, database admin, software developer, cloud architect, VP. None feel as risky to claim as #trans, and yet, none of those other labels are as authentic, none require as much vulnerability to share.\n\nReflecting on my childhood reveals a difficult truth: when I was in primary school, I was one of the girls. Everyone (except me) knew it, but in a small southern California town in 1992, none of us had the social vocabulary to talk about gender fluidity, least of all me. By the time I turned 16, I had figured out how to pass as though I was over 21, and very clearly “a man”, because this made it much safer to exist in public.\nIn essence, to survive childhood, I traded the freedom to express myself authentically for a thinly-constructed sense of safety, and I’ve been paying an internal cost for that choice ever since. My close friends have all known … to some degree or another. I’ve always done little things to honor my feminine side, even as my career took off and I became modestly well known in Open Source as a guy. That exposure, that network, helped me learn a lot about who I am and connect with an amazingly beautiful &amp; diverse network of people.\nNow I’m done holding back who I am.\nYesterday’s #WomenInTech Summit was incredible for a lot of reasons, and it was the firs second time that I’ve been at an event with my F/OSS community since openly starting this transition. Most notable for me was the message (carried by several speakers) that we women bring a power, an opportunity, to tech companies through our ability to share our authentic, vulnerable selves. That strength isn’t unique to women.\nHowever, it is the only way forward for me. I know that I won’t be able to succeed in my next professional endeavor unless I embrace this truth.\nSo, hi there, internet.\nI’m a queer trans woman in tech.\n","id":"/blog/2019-hi-queer-trans/","title":"Hi, I'm queer and trans"},"/blog/2019-in-review/":{"body":"It's been two years since I came out. So much has changed. So much has improved.\nIf 2018 was about accepting that truth, 2019 was about taking action on it..\nFor starters, I changed all my online profiles this year. I changed my name this year.\nI realized that my career choices over the past several years had led me uncomfortably far from my ethics. (More on that later…)\nThe result? I spent eight months of 2019 uninsured and underemployed, but still very busy.\n\nI interviewed at dozens of tech companies … and only got one offer.\nI burned through 😱 $30,000 😱 of savings because I kept thinking, surely I’ll land the next interview! I would have reorganized my life sooner, had I known I’d be without regular work for a total of 20 months.\nI underestimated how much misogyny and transphobia still rule the tech industry.\nI wrestled with an increasing understanding of a contextual, intersectional identity, and adjusted to the embrace of my gender.\nYeah, I’m trans, so what? If you don’t like it, please get off this ride right now.\nOne might say, 2019 was a year of course correction.\nI’m much more involved in things that matter to me now, and also more aware of what I will not compromise on in order to earning a living. Straddling between a day job in the tech industry and a vow I took years ago that I would work to benefit all sentient beings … continues to be a challenge in time and emotional management.\nThis means realigning my financial goals and re-prioritizing my time … but let’s look back at 2019 a little more.\nI did a few things!\n\nIt wasn’t all just rumination and navel-gazing… I actually did a few things in 2019!\n\nstarted this blog\ngrew tits (heck yeah I’m proud of them!)\njoined a podcast for my first time (that was fun!)\ngot a chapter published in a book about the intersection of the buddha-dharma &amp; my experience being trans\njoined the Kubernetes community &amp; accepted a nomination to their Code of Conduct Committee\ncontinued my role as a board member on Seattle’s local sex-positive 501(c)3\nworked behind the scenes with the QueerCon board to improve their trans inclusivity\ngot a job at Microsoft (ikr? they’ve changed… but still… it’s weird)\nspoke at a few conferences\n\nML4ALL, one of the best regional conferences I’ve ever been to.

Even though most of my colleagues have been very encouraging, even reminding me that Microsoft isn’t as monopolistic or walled-off as it once was, there are still some things which bear clarification (especially for any readers that have known me during the OpenStack or MySQL days).\n\n\nFirst off, no, I’m not leaving open source. I believe that humanity’s growth accelerates by sharing our tools. For any business, it is important to delineate which software provides specific &amp; unique value, and then to weigh the cost of privately maintaining those tools vs. the cost of participating in shared development of those tools. In my experience, it’s almost always better to share the tools.\nI look forward to bringing this view with me to work every day, and (as far as I can tell) my current employer appreciates this view more than many other companies I’ve worked for in the past.\n\nSince the end of 2016, I haven’t been active in any particular upstream community. Between trying to run an OpenStack-based cloud hosting company, the end of that position, coming out as trans, and my dreadful job hunt ever since (which I rarely talk about) … I haven’t had the funding to travel to a lot of conferences that I used to.\nI am exceedingly grateful to travel support programs and generous friends that gave me places to crash so I could get to #LesbiansWhoTech, #ML4ALL, #OpenStackSummit, and #DEFCON this year. And it was delightful to see friends when I made it out to OpenStack Denver, even if I’m not an active contributor any longer. &lt;3’s to you all!\nIn this time, my focus has shifted away from “do F/OSS for F/OSS’s sake” to accommodate a more nuanced view of the impact we – software developers – have. I spent a lot of time reflecting on how ML/AI is reshaping our society, and on how cloud technology already has.\nI’ve seen OpenStack Ironic used in places that I would never have wanted my creations to be: surveillance industries and even a foreign military.\nI also have the incredible satisfaction of knowing some amazing scientific research powered by that same code: Ironic is enabling scientists to study particle collisions and work on cancer cures.\n\nSo anyway… my attention has shifted towards social and societal issues: trans rights, surveillance capitalism, digital freedoms, the right of all humans to self-determination and self-expression. I’m trying to catch up and learning a lot from others’ research in this area, and have begun giving talks on the impact of Machine Learning. I also hold a seat on the board of a non-profit that teaches about consent culture, and I was just elected to a seat on the Kubernetes Code of Conduct Committee.\nBeing paid specifically to build open source software is just one way I can work to make the world more open and inclusive. Having enough money and time that I can support causes is another path, as is advocating for change from within a large organization.\n2020 is going to see me doing all three of these…\nWish me luck!\n","id":"/blog/2019-job-hunt-is-over/","title":"The Job Hunt Is Over"},"/blog/2019-transitioning-is-strength/":{"body":"\nYou gave up everything I’ve spent my life fighting for.\nI can’t imagine how much you must have been hurting inside to choose to do that.\n\nSarah Novotny\n\n\n\n\nLife, Changes\nA few days ago, I was having dinner with Sarah at one of our old haunts — it’s been four years since she moved away from Seattle, and the same Ethiopian restaurant is still here, still serving up the same delicious dinners on platters of Teff Injera. Somehow, it seems longer than four years. So much has changed in that time.\nWe’ve both built our careers around open source, and I have respected and admired her tenacity and her compassion for as long as I’ve known her. Sarah is several years my senior in the community, with considerably more reputation and public visibility, and yet in the past decade we’ve both moved through roles as project leads and VPs, sharing stories along the way.\nCity Mouse or Country Mouse?\n\nAs dinner went on, conversation turned to housing, to dreams of future plans.\nJust after she moved away, I lived for a year in a beautiful downtown penthouse with a water view over the ferry docks, and the farmer’s market just three blocks away… Living there taught me how much my sleep cycle and mental health benefit from being connected to the sunset, and how much I enjoy an urban lifestyle that’s hard to find in the US. I’d like to find that again.\nI also want to have land in the countryside again. I used to have five acres, but gave it up in a divorce; I think twenty acres would be good — enough space for friends, some chickens, dogs, and farms to grow our own food.\nAnd we talked about rebuilding our lives, the ongoing process of figuring out who we are in light of physical changes. We’ve each given Ignite Talks about what a changing identity means at the intersection of technology, public perception, and personal change.\nIs Perception == Identity?\nI say I came out as trans because I wasn’t willing to give up my social and professional network, so the only option was to ask everyone to change their perception of my identity. I wasn’t willing to sever ties with my coding history even as I changed my name and online handles, though I’m still struggling with this. Everyone’s journey is radically unique, and I learned that there’s no playbook for transitioning as a mid-career professional in open source. My reputation is a valuable assets built over fifteen years, with ties to a global &amp; multicultural community. That reputation, it’s part of my identity.\nThe me that my network knew wasn’t me any more, and that left only one option: accept the risks that come from telling everyone.\nA Coming Out Plan\n\nWhy don't you just dress like a guy for the interview?\n\nwell-meaning male colleague\n\n\nI began this gender-journey with a vague plan — I couldn’t transition within the VP role that I had in 2017, so I left.\nI took six months off work before starting a role as Staff Researcher in the Samsung Open Source Group. I had a supportive manager, and would be paid well to work from home and guide their open source cloud contributions. This should have set me up for several years – enough time for my plan – but circumstances unrelated to me ended that very suddenly ….\nBy this time, I’d had a year of HRT and donated most of my pre-transition clothes. I call this time the Uncanny Valley.\nThe Uncanny (Gender) Valley\n\nInterviewing in 2019 was a nightmare – my resume and my reputation got me dozens of in-person interviews for roles as a director, or as a principal / staff engineer… and even though I’d held roles at that level for the past five years, no one would make an offer! Almost every interviewer was a man in their late 40’s, and they were all suddenly, visibly, uncomfortable around me.\nHearing of my struggles, a few well-meaning male colleagues suggested that I just dress like a guy for interviews….\nOuch.\nThey didn’t know how much that hurt.\nMy Gender Is Not Armor Any More\nSo after almost a year without health insurance and two years without steady income, my transition plan was a wreck in the rear-view mirror. I had a dwindling savings account and a shrinking network, and I settled for the first tangible offer I got. It’s the same career level I held in 2012 -- but it will pay the rent and the doctor’s bills.\nYou know what’s more important than my career?\nHappiness, and I’m happy in my own body for the first time in 20 years.\nYou know what I want back?\nMy career.\nStrength In Vulnerability\nWhen I had finished sharing my story with Sarah, she shook her head and, with all the kindness in the world, said words I’ll never forget:\n\n\"You gave up everything I’ve spent my life fighting for. I can’t imagine how much you must have been hurting inside to choose to do that.\"\n\n\"Yeah, you get it,\" I thought.\nI’ve learned through experience how much our identity is defined by others, how who we are exists in relation to how we’re perceived, and how painful it is to live with the cognitive dissonance of an identity that looks nothing like one’s sense of self.\nI’m not wearing armor to hide any more.\nAnd it feels so good to be seen.\n","id":"/blog/2019-transitioning-is-strength/","title":"Transitioning Is an Act of Strength"},"/blog/2019-what-happened-openstack/":{"body":"The project is still quite healthy and is following the usual hype curve: OpenStack is finally mature enough that it’s less interesting to talk about, so it’s understandable that people think something happened.\nThe folks asking me this question are generally curios and good intentioned, and I think my answer says a lot about my professional background, so even during an interview I indulge in a short ramble.\nI know, I know … I should have written about it at the time, but I had other things going on and wasn’t making space in my life to write. So I’ve decided to revisit the topic today. Next time someone asks me, I’ll just point them here 😉\n\nWe all knew that, for the long-term success of the OpenStack ecosystem, we needed a hyper-scale OpenStack public cloud to succeed, and a healthy set of SaaS applications to be built upon the IaaS/PaaS layers that we had. We knew there needed to be at more than one hyperscale implementation to avoid a gravity problem (in the early days, that was RackSpace).\nPublicly, lots of folks were talking about this; common headlines compared OpenStack to AWS, and every VC and analyst wanted to know if it was ready for the Enterprise yet. I even sat on a panel to discuss this very question! (edit: updated with link)\nBut over time, this key component of our success never materialized. Why was that?\nBack in 2014 I was working at HP Cloud. Money was pouring into OpenStack and we were all riding high on that. This was the year that OpenStack hype peaked, and I will never forget the Carnival at the Paris Summit. Tre magnifique! From outside, however, it may not have been obvious that this was coming from Telcos and Hardware Vendors seeking to influence the direction of OpenStack. Specifically, these companies wanted to create the technological basis for integrated private cloud solutions they could take to market quickly.\nPrivately, we could see that these market forces were opposed to actually achieving hyperscale. The Big Tent was a bold move to try and address some of these issues. We (that is, the Technical Committee) did what we could, but in the end we couldn’t fix the problem because we didn’t control the purse strings.\nYou see, almost every company contributing substantially to OpenStack at that time relied on Enterprise customers. That’s a nice way of saying well-known brands who spend a lot of money on each other every year. Unlike the hyper-scalers, Enterprise customers generally do not have an interest in building their own servers or writing their own switch firmware. They buy these things (and the support contracts for them) from other Enterprise companies that make them, and those companies want to keep making money from these deals.\nMeanwhile, distros and operators struggled to make OpenStack installable so that they could roll out deployments to satisfy the market demand. And the Enterprise demand for new private cloud regions was incredibly high! A lot of internal pressure was being put on the OpenStack developer teams (at the Distros, Telco’s, HW vendors) to create software that worked well at a scale these Enterprise Customers needed, roughly in the 1,000’s to 10,000’s of cores with a small number of regions for geographic resiliency.\nHowever, building a distributed system for a scale of 10,000 cores is fundamentally different than building for 10,000,000 cores. Besides just changing the code, scaling up by another three orders of magnitude requires fundamental changes in how any business operate. The margins would need to become much, much smaller. Gone would be the 3rd party support contracts, the B2B deals, the value-added software – the grease in the sales’ teams wheels. The enterprise hardware &amp; software giants were not willing to restructure their businesses that much, and the organic growth of companies like OVH was too slow (even though I think they are still on the right track).\n\nCreating a viable, open source, hyperscale cloud software solution was against the best interest of the companies most heavily investing in OpenStack’s development.\n\nIn my usual fashion, I tried to draw this on a napkin one day. The original is long since lost, so I’ve redrawn it from memory below.\n\nInfluence was flowing from the wrong direction. Product management within the Telco, Hardware, and Distro space — that is, companies like ATT, Cisco, Dell, and RedHat — were pouring in money to pay developers to have influence and write code, funding lavish parties and inflating salaries (in full disclosure, I certainly enjoyed the parties, and while I got paid well, I didn’t make out nearly as well as a lot of folks did). Meanwhile, Operators were getting further and further behind the release-train, had little voice (they were busy operating the clouds, after all) … and the end-users of the cloud (app developers) had almost no voice at all.\nEventually, revenues would need to come from the growth of supported businesses on top of the cloud (ie, app developers’ success), but we couldn’t get there because operators weren’t able to scale up enough, or maintain cross-cloud compatibility well enough, for a healthy market to flourish on top of the cloud. Everyone on the left-hand side of that diagram was too busy trying to differentiate to win deals against each other.\nWith this going on, the upstream technical team leads — who could see the problem — were lobbying inside our respective companies to change the priorities. We convinced some managers and executives to get onboard with tactical investments in code and infrastructure, but we couldn’t get enough backing for the larger changes that were needed.\nAs long as the financial influencers were focused on the business models of mid-sized customers (MSP’s and Enterprise markets), they were not willing to invest in the massive strategic efforts needed to make OpenStack competitive in the hyperscale market. The vast majority of developers, whose project goals were dictated by PMs and executives within their employers, were thus busy driving features (designed to take advantage of “value-added integrations”, the grease of the Enterprise sales cycle) into the codebase, and no one could fix the core issues that had become apparent to all the deployers who were busily trying to scale up their clouds.\nYou see, the successful hyperscalers had already removed middleware marginal cost. Google, AWS, even Facebook, all make their own servers, switches, storage, etc. They fork open source projects then pay developers to maintain and improve private versions so that they can stay ahead (some projects are now trying to prevent this). These companies pioneered scale by shaving the costs off their infrastructure, but those efficiencies have not made it back to the Enterprise market. They became the behemoths they are, in no small part, by building processes, teams, and hardware to break any reliance on 3rd parties for software, hardware, or support.\nSo, you see, creating a viable, open source, hyperscale cloud software solution was against the best interest of the companies most heavily investing in OpenStack’s development.\nWhen you’re looking at other cloud products, think about similar conflicts of interest that might be affecting your favorite spokespersons today… (I’m looking at you, kubernetes)\nThose of us who joined OpenStack early and dreamed big, well, we had no chance of building those dreams within OpenStack. It became something less hype-worthy but perhaps even more useful: an extensible tool for mid-scale infrastructure automation, powering thousands of businesses around the world, including many non-profit and public-good institutions.\nAnd – just to be clear – I’m very glad to have been able to help in my small way to build a tool that has been used so widely for good.\n\nI am publishing this now in the hope that it can serve as a warning to everyone out there who is investing in Kubernetes. You’ll never be able to run it as effectively, at the same scale, as GKE does – unless you also invest in a holistic change to your organization.\nEven then, if you’re using Kubernetes, you probably won’t succeed, because it isn’t in Google’s best interest to let anyone else actually compete with GKE.\nAnd that’s probably OK. In fact, OpenStack + Kubernetes is probably just fine for what ever you’re building, and neither project is going anywhere any time soon.\n\nIf another company wants to stand a chance in the hyperscale space, it will need to look holistically at its entire business apparatus, and either repeat the Google/Facebook/Amazon model of privatizing open source and investing in your own server fabrication or band together with other vertically-focused, open source businesses in order to compete.\nIf you do that, please drop me a line.\nI’d love to help.\n","id":"/blog/2019-what-happened-openstack/","title":"What Happened To OpenStack"},"/blog/2019-whats-in-a-name/":{"body":"A MAN IN A frock held up his right hand and said a few words, and I got to fill out some paperwork.

When I look back at the tumultuous political landscape that is 2020, these two events will doubtless color my memories of this year in ways that I can not yet really understand.\n\nEighteen months ago, in the summer of 2019, I doubted whether I would ever work in the tech industry again.\nEighteen months ago, I was in the best shape I’d been in ever since a fateful tick bite I got while backpacking Germany in 2001. This led to a rapid decline in my health over the coming years, which I spent in and out of hospitals, and eventually doctors reached a determination that I was infected with a trifecta of bacteria – Babesia, Ehrlichia, and Borrelia. A decade later, I put that all behind me and swore to maintain better health and be more cautious outdoors. By 2015 I was fit, if not athletic, running 5k’s and even hiking small mountains now and then.\nThe summer months of 2019 saw me doing a little off-roading, move across town to save on rent, camp at a regional burn (Critical Northwest), build one of the most intense camps at the big burn (Suspended Animation), and then go to DefCon!\nTake it easy during my sabbatical? Nah, not me! If something is worth doing, I commit to doing it completely.\nThinking back, it’s a stark contrast to today: it’s hard to walk even a quarter mile before my heart pounds and I start gasping for air, reaching for an albuterol inhaler. COVID-19 has knocked me down, but not out of the fight. With help from several friends, I bought a house and moved into it, though “settling in” will likely take me many months as I don’t have the stamina to do much each day. I’ve also been diving in to new projects at Microsoft, working within the Confidential Computing Consortium and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, and keeping very busy within our product teams.\nI’ve been loving the challenge of wearing a Program Manager hat, supporting our engineering teams in ways that I struggled to do when I was a Master Engineer at HPCloud. And, to my surprise, I’m embracing the opportunity to bring myself more authentically to work in ways that I have not been able to since I left Hydra Media in 2007.\n\n… “more authentically” …. This is an odd phrase, worth pondering for a moment.\nIt implies there is a spectrum of authenticity, and that at some times we can be more or less authentic than at other times. It also seems to imply, at least in my usage of it, some judgement that one state might be better than the other. Authenticity might be measured in the number of masks we wear in a given social environment, or the distance between how we present from one moment to the next, the difference between our workself and our homeself, our innerself and one of many outerselves that we share in the different circumstances of our ever-changing lives.\nWhen I say “distance” here, I imagine a vector-space of infinite identities comprised of all possible lived experiences, whether through different bodies, or in different cultures, speaking different languages, with different socio-economic privilege, in different religions … and how this affects all the infinite ways of being seen by our fellow humans and existing in their contexts. Because how others see us is separable from how we see ourselves.\nTo be human is to be seen as human, even if we are the only one seeing inside ourselves.\nIdentity exists like the sea shore, a constantly shifting border between our inner senses and our best guess of how others perceive us. The ocean waves will never know what it is to be dry land; they can only identify with it through the pressure, the solidity, with which the beach pushes back against the oncoming tide.\n\nAnd so I find myself, on a Sunday afternoon, sun streaming into my bedroom along with the distant scent of pine trees and the pacific ocean, writing this post and rehearsing a talk titled Crossing The Gender Divide, simultaneously inspired and terrified that Microsoft has given me a platform to talk about my transition, my experience of identity, and the path by which I learned to see (some more of) my own biases.\nI’ll be delivering it tomorrow. The invite has gone out from several CVPs… to something like 10,000 different calendars. This is the largest audience I’ve ever spoken to.

It took more than six months.\n\n\nFriday, April 10th, my work team had our first Virtual Happy Hour, so I was enjoying a little sun in my back yard and a tumbler of Scotch. We’re a relatively new team, and only had a few months to get to know each other before quarantine-in-place orders went into effect in Washington, so the social time together was very welcome.\nWhen I woke up Saturday morning, I thought I had a hang-over at first, but by 9am I had a 103F fever. Anxiety was making my heart race — I had been jogging a couple times that week, and had ordered takeout on Monday and Tuesday. Can joggers really spread the ‘rona? Could it be food poisoning from take-out left-overs? Maybe this is something else…\nWith Tylenol, my fever went down to 101.5. As I spent the day resting, it started getting harder to breathe, and I’m grateful that my phone has a pulse oximeter built in. It didn’t feel like any flu I’ve ever had … my partner Tam was getting worried, so she came over. I remember saying to her that it felt like a Maine Coon curled up on my chest, minus the purring. It was hard to breathe. My hands, feet, and face were tingly, like I was hyper-ventilating, except I wasn’t, and my SpO2 stats were dropping…\nBy 4pm, I had a temp of 104.1 – I was still taking Tylenol – and my SpO2 had gone down to 93. Talking made everything worse and I didn’t want to call 911, so Tam started calling around for tele-health options that were open on the weekend. We reached someone. At 7pm, my SpO2 dipped below 90, and the tele-doctor said it was time to go to the Emergency Room.\n\nThe hallway was completely devoid of life – save for the nurse on a radio behind me, narrating my progress to invisible people.\n\nIn hindsight, the strangest thing about the ER visit is that they drew blood and ran a liver/kidney panel before they did the nasal swab for COVID-19. At the time, the hardest thing was simply being cold and alone. The staff informed me that they needed to minimize the use of PPE, but also needed to change PPE when leaving the room, and therefore were going to come in to see me as few times as possible — and only one at a time. They gave me the thinnest of blankets. I’m glad I brought my winter coat.\nA machine hooked to my right ear monitored my SpO2, but I think it’s real purpose was just to keep me on edge. Every time I relaxed my SpO2 would drop again and trigger more squawking, putting me back on high alert. No one ever came to check on it.\nAfter about five hours, a nasal swab, some x-rays, two cups of apple juice, a blood draw, and anxiously trying not to pass out, the attending doctor came in. I could tell because she wore the best PPE and she introduced herself instead of prepping me for another test. My x-rays showed some occlusions and my bloodwork was “ok”. The COVID-19 test came back negative, but she said it was only accurate about 70% of the time, and with the x-ray and all my other symptoms they were confident it was COVID… But, because I didn’t need a ventilator and my kidneys were doing OK, she said I should go home, get lots of rest, and come back if anything got worse.\nWhen I finally left, the hallway was completely devoid of life – save for the voice of the nurse on a radio behind me, narrating my progress down the hall to invisible people.\n\nI rested at home for a week — really rested. I didn’t work, because it was too difficult just to sit up for long. I binged on netflix while my housemate brought me food, wearing a mask and bleach-wiping every dish I had touched. After about ten days, I slowly started working again, and by day 14 I felt well enough that I thought I could leave the house. Yes, I checked with my doctor and followed the CDC guidelines. On day 15, I tried to do a little gardening – about 20 minutes of gentle weeding. I collapsed, light-headed and woosy, my ears ringing and my heart pounding, and I needed help getting inside.\nI crashed the next day. My fever came back. The inhaler they gave me after the ER wasn’t helping enough any more, so I went in to Swedish’s COVID Respiratory Center, where they gave me two more scripts and a kind-yet-stern talking to for not resting enough. I spent the next few weeks at home, resting, with the hospital staff checking in on me by text message every day and by phone every couple days.\n\nI started writing this post around week three. As I finish the post now, the calendar tips into week seven. This was, by all accounts, a “mild” case because I never needed to be on any life-assisting devices. I’ve been sharing status updates on social media in the hopes that, maybe, a few more people will take this seriously, wear a mask, and a few less people get sick.\nI shared a summary on Twitter today and it feels appropriate to repost it here –\n\nWeek 1: ER, very high fevers, bed rest, Rx to help cough\nWeek 2: false recovery, collapsed in yard\nWeek 3: unstable HR, more Rx, bed rest\nWeek 4: bed rest, no fevers, still coughing\nWeek 5: able to sit up at my computer for most of the day!\nWeek 6: I cooked for myself, and went for an hour-long walk! I’m almost crying with joy and relief\n\n\nI can’t believe it’s been 45 days since I went to the ER. It feels like last week and at the same time it feels like a year ago.\nI’m finally getting back a little sense of homeostasis – I cooked dinner last night, and brunch today, and did some baking. Took a drive while it was sunny yesterday. I’m starting to pack, and hopefully moving in a month.

I appreciate the opportunity to address them.\n(1) What should OSI do about the tens of millions of people who regularly collaborate to build software online (often calling that activity, colloquially, open source) but have literally no idea what OSI is or what it does?\nThe OSI has an obligation to support education about the rationale behind the OSD, and how this translates into tangible (and positive) impact on businesses -- impacts that create the open and collaborative environment that we all colloquially call \"open source\". Nuance is valuable, and, as with any rapidly-adopted term, nuance is easily lost.\nI believe The Four Opens provide a valuable model we can use to distinguish between different aspects of open source, which are each crucial components of our community's \"tribal knowledge\".\n\nopen source: fully open software, without a commercial \"value add\" or \"enterprise edition\"\nopen design: the process of creating the software is itself open\nopen development: all aspects of the development process (code review, roadmaps, etc) are also open\nopen community: the community is open and accessible, and actively works to be inclusive to everyone\n\nHowever, simply speaking about open source at conferences (as I and many other current and past Board members have done) is not enough. We'll need to do more, and I think we should directly engage with influencers in business, media, and legal affairs to enlist their help in educating the vibrant and world-wide open source developer community upon which nearly all businesses in the world now depend.\n(2) If an Ethical Software Initiative sprung up tomorrow, what should OSI's relationship to it be?\nI've written about this a bit, and weighed in on the Ethical Source discussions over the past few years. You'll find some of my thoughts on twitter. That thread is a pretty good summation of my opinions, and my 2021 platform statement itself includes more thoughts on this. I won't repeat them here.\nI believe the OSI must maintain its neutrality -- this is key to the functioning of the Open Source Definition as a business tool which drives collaboration up just as it drives down the market costs of common tools and infrastructure.\nHowever, I also believe there must be room for developers to consider alternative approaches to software licensing that account for our changing legal, social, and geopolitical circumstances.\nWhat ever experiments in Ethical Source (or other use-restricted) licenses arise, I believe the OSI should develop healthy working relationships to those organizations. I'm not unaware of the history (though I'm surely not aware of all the history) between these organizations, and I trust that we can all navigate that history as professionals and as adults.\n(3) When a license decision involves a topic on which the Open Source Definition is vague or otherwise unhelpful, what should the board do?\nThe Board should support and encourage the discussion, weighing in as individuals rather than board members, and potentially engaging outside councel (if and when needed) or reaching out to our networks to solicit input and facilitate the discussion.\nThe board should continue to consider whether it would be appropriate to make any additions to the OSD to account for changing circumstances -- though I remain of the opinion, given what I know today, that no changes in the OSD are likely to be necessary.\n(4) What role should the new staff play in license evaluation (or the OSD more generally)?\nBroadly speaking, I believe that OSI Staff should be empowered to support the activities of the foundation, which likely includes actions such as: assisting with platforms/tools, scheduling meetings and ensuring minutes are recorded and publicly available, building partnerships, amplifying awareness, and carrying out the outreach needed to ensure that all necessary opinions (including legal councel if needed) are represented during a license evaluation.\nStaff members may facilitate, but should not make decisions regarding license evaluations, and should not be seen to \"hold the pen\" in the decision-making process.\nContact Me\nYou can reach me on Twitter at @aevavoom or by\nemail at \"aeva at aeva dot online\".

Read on for the description of my platform and goals.\nThis post is shared on my personal site and on the 2021 OSI Board Elections page.\n\nEditing Note\nAs the OSI Election was originally run in February and re-run in July, I have updated my platform post, both here and on the OSI wiki, to reflect a change in my role at Microsoft. Incidentally, that change also better positions me to support the OSI. I have also made some minor edits to my platform to reflect changes in the current political and technical state of relevant affairs, which are also reflected below. The original content is preserved in the OSI wiki history.\nAbout Me\nI am a software engineer, a buddhist, and a trans and non-binary person. Today, I work in the Azure Office of the CTO's Open Source Ecosystem team, and engage in technical and community building work in both the\nConfiential Computing Consortium (CCC) and\nCloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). I am also a member\nof the Kubernetes Code of Conduct\nCommittee,\nto which I've brought a framework for Consent Culture and a Restorative\napproach to our incident handling procedures. I previously served on the\nOpenStack Technical Committee, led the OpenStack\nIronic project team, participated as a\ndeveloper and speaker in the MySQL community for almost a decade, and have\ncontributed to many other projects, such as Ansible, Matrix, Mixxx, Elastic,\nand OpenVZ. I also served as a board member for the Consent\nAcademy, a Seattle-based 501c(3) non-profit, for\nseveral years. Some of my views on the internal interplay between gender and\nbuddhism were recently published in\nTranscending.\nViews On Open Source\nIn 2021, open source software is used at every company and in many physical\nproducts we rely on, from phones to fridges to cars. As a result, some (mostly\noutside this community) now believe that \"open source\" is a business model (not\ntrue), or that \"open sourcing\" something is a one-off event (also not true).\nThis lexical confusion continues to pose a risk: views not grounded in\nexperience and an understanding of the legal frameworks (licensing and\ngovernance) belie the complexity of choices which ultimately shape the\ncommunities of successful open source projects. A proliferation of mismanaged\nopen source software projects will create unnecessary security and legal risk\nfor our institutions.\nTo counter this, I believe we need to increase educational outreach with\nspecific focus towards:\n\neducating business leaders to empower them with the lexical tools to engage\nin nuanced discussions about open source strategy;\nencouraging lawyers to develop a deeper understanding at the intersection of\ndata privacy, technology (ab)use, and international copyright;\nengaging in the discussion around open source software supply chain security\nas a community-wide issue.\n\nI agree with the objective others have stated in previous years: that the OSI\nshould be sufficiently funded so this work does not entirely fall on volunteers.\nI would like to see outreach to grow the affiliate network continue so we can\nsupport increasing staff dedicated to this mission. And lastly, I could imagine\nadditional work within, or akin to, ClearlyDefined, that might support one or\nmore of these goals, though I do not have any specific solution in mind.\nBroader Concerns\nOur society is, once again, grappling with the realization that technology is\nnot neutral: like any tool, software can be used for both good and evil, to\nuplift or to oppress. In 2015 I was confronted with this, called on to brief a\nforeign military on my open source contributions, it became clear they were\nusing software I had built in ways I did not support.\nI appreciate the debate on ethical source licenses, and believe this comes from\nour great care for the impact our work has on society. Though I do not believe\nlicenses are the right tool for this today, I appreciate the discussions and\nlook forward to learning more about the tools available. I believe we need\nbetter laws regulating the civil and military use of certain technologies, for\nmore lawyers and policy-makers to become educated on technology, and especially\nits impact on privacy and civil rights.\nWith spotlights on the abuses of machine learning and Facial Recognition\nTechnology, which have already resulted in calls to ban FRT in the\nHouse and in some\nstates, on\nsocial media and algorithmic bias, and on the principle of digital sovereignty,\nI believe that the ethical use of open source will continue to be an important,\nand emotionally-charged, conversation, in the years ahead.\nMy Background\nIn 2003, before I knew about the OSI or OSD, I had an epiphany as I started my\nsecond job: I could no longer use tools I had built simply because that code\nwas owned by my former (and already out of business) employer. That epiphany\nstarted me down the open source path, and I quickly came to see how this\napproach, if generalized, was more ethical than the alternative: if everyone\ncould share their tools, we could all build better technolgy (and products)\nfaster. Automation, the building and sharing of tools so that others may more\nquickly create better tools, is one of humanity's greatest and most unique\nstrengths\n(not my article, but captures my views well).\nIn the early 2010's, while building OpenStack, I had the opportunity to work\nwith several of OSI's former board members, who helped me deepen my\nunderstanding of the effect which the OSD had had on my career (unbeknownst to\nme before that). I've come to value this framework and the thought and care that\nhas gone into creating and sustaining it over the years. I would like the\nopportunity to contribute back to the community.\nWhat's In A Name?\nIf you've known me for more than the last few years, you would have known me\nwith a different name: \"Devananda\" never felt appropriate, only barely\nsufficient. The timing of the pandemic and the nature of\nopen source community interaction means that I haven't had the chance to\nconnect with a lot of old colleagues and friends since changing my name. Humans\nare social by nature, and our identities, even our sense of self, is deeply\nconnected to how our family, friends, and community know us. However, like open\nsource software projects that sometimes must rebrand themselves, I found that I\nneeded to change my name, no matter how disruptive it would be.  I mention this\nhere in the hopes of connecting with folks who may not recognize \"Aeva\", but\nwho would recognize my previous name.\nContact\nYou can reach me on Twitter at @aevavoom or by\nemail at \"aeva at aeva dot online\".

Check back for a follow-up to this post when I get around to actually writing it 😅\n","id":"/blog/2021-reflecting-on-2020/","title":"An overdue reflection on 2020"},"/blog/2023-oss-security-conundrum/":{"body":"Policy makers in both the US and the EU are currently debating several efforts to improve the security of digital infrastructure, including broad new regulations such as SOSSA and the CRA. In light of high profile recent events, we are all aware that open source software is a critical part of software infrastructure as a whole. Security issues related to popular open source projects are in the news and in policy conversations. As open source professionals, we hope that policy makers carefully consider the distinction between open source projects and products.\n\nPolicy makers who are most familiar with commercial software and procurement-based policies will find that open source software presents different motivators and mechanisms. Extending commercial software policies to open source will miss the very features that make open source unique, and regulations previously written for physical goods’ supply chains cannot be cleanly mapped to a digital ecosystem whose innovation is founded, at least in the US, on free speech and individual creative expression.\nInverting Linus’ Law\nLet’s start with the combination of principles and pragmatics that underlie the ethos of how open source projects approach security flaws. Penned by Eric Raymond, this is Linus’ Law:\n\nIn principle, transparency builds trust. Pragmatically, it is easier to fix things when you have more fixers available to help. Since there are more developers outside of any given company than inside it, open source software ought to be more secure than closed source software. While several famous projects (such as the Linux Kernel, Kubernetes, and WordPress) are the result of the collaboration of thousands of developers, it may surprise you to learn that the average number of maintainers per project is one. Unfortunately, most projects don’t benefit from the attention of hundreds of developers fixing bugs. In fact, in the past few years, we have seen significant attention being paid to finding more flaws. Linus’ Law could be restated for this decade in its inverse:\n\nOver time, all software will need to be updated due to flaws that are not yet discovered. This implies two important questions for policy makers: (1) who should be on the hook to perform these future updates, and (2) what is the minimum set of safe software development practices to minimize the risk of catastrophic flaws in the future?\nProjects and Products\nIn addressing the above questions, policy makers will encounter open source in two forms: projects and products. This distinction, less relevant to a consumer of digital goods, is germaine to policy discussions. Projects represent the open and evolving development of capabilities driven by a community. Products, on the other hand, represent units of value sold by vendors. Over the last twenty-some years, many open source projects have become, or are integrated within, popular commercial products. In fact, a debate continues within the tech sector over the use of the terms open core and commercial open source to delineate a specific business practice related to withholding key features from the project’s community specifically to bolster the value of related products.\nWhile communities have an interest in improving their projects, and vendors have an interest in improving their products, the mechanisms and motivations differ. Mickos’ Law highlights this difference:\n\nAdding to some confusion, these often include the same people. When open source projects become essential to vendor products, vendors typically hire influential maintainers from the project community. When the maintainer is allowed to continue their open source work, this serves to support the vendor’s product by ensuring the health of the project, and provides the vendor with influence in the project direction. (Notably, sometimes vendors hire open source maintainers and then direct them to cease, or reduce, their open source work, in favor of improving the product!) These vendors, in some cases the sole maintainers of important open source projects, also provide critical services that support the open source community. This creates a delicate balance of dependencies.\nOnce open source projects become commercialized, any policy that addresses minimum requirements, liability, or verifiable assurances of the product must be sensitive to the project’s origin as well. Successful open source communities will seek to ensure their project is secure and operable, but often not due to direct financial incentives. Whereas the vendors will seek a similar outcome for their products. In their case, however, will they allocate their developer resources to improve the open source project? Or perhaps hold them back to focus on their commercial product (leaving the open source project unaddressed)?\nHow About An Example?\nImagine a pretend open source project we’ll call Graphtheus. It started as an open source project, became popular, and now has a vendor who provides various “enterprise” features for a cost. We’ll call the vendor NeoChrono. NeoChrono wants people to love and trust Graphtheus, because many Graphtheus users are potential enterprise customers of NeoChrono. They support the open source project since it is the heart of their product offering, and makes up about 90% of the code in their commercial product. However, NeoChrono also needs to maintain a feature gap between the open source project and their product – this gap is protected as their unique business value. This creates some disincentives to contribute to the open source project.\n\n\nGiven the need to fix a security feature, the NeoChrono engineering team is incentivized to have an internal conversation: should we make the fix in the open source project, or should we hold back just a bit so that the enterprise version has better security?\n\n\nGiven the need to sell more licenses for the enterprise edition of NeoChrono, the product design team is similarly incentivized to have an internal conversation: should we contribute this usability enhancing feature to the open source project, or develop it internally and integrate it only into our product?\n\n\nEach situation will differ. While some developers may altruistically fix security issues upstream, and some security issues may only be repairable in the upstream codebase, other companies will see an opportunity to sell “hardened” versions of an open source project and hold back the fix. Sure, the open source community can implement a security feature without the vendor’s support, and even if a single company controls the open source code base, individuals or other vendors could fork the project, creating a competing project with a separate code base, but doing this requires an investment of time and resources.\nForking also carries social risk – the risk that others do not follow, or, worse, publicly shame the attempt as needlessly detracting from a common cause. And so, some software vendors succeed precisely because they are seen as “good maintainers” of the open source project – that is, while supporting the development of the open source project, they are successful in maintaining a slight commercial advantage to drive software sales.\nIn summary, commercial software vendors, even those lauded for being “good at open source”, are incentivized to keep open source slightly less secure, less operable, and less feature-rich at all times in order to maintain a competitive advantage within their products.\nConflicting Interests\nWe’re not suggesting that vendors are bad actors, obstructing security fixes to open source projects or withholding usability and security enhancements, but certainly, some do, some of the time, because there is a strong motivation at play that biases toward these behaviors. We are suggesting, however, that if policy makers only consider the commercial vendors of products based on open source, they will miss an important part of the ecosystem. They may inadvertently provide vendors more encouragement to withhold fixes to open source projects. They will also fail to address the millions of open source projects that are not supported by any vendor.\nMuch effort in the open source security space is already spent finding flaws and creating mechanisms to safely communicate their solutions, and as external expectations (perhaps in the form of new regulations) are placed on open source communities to account for and improve their security posture, we propose the following considerations:\n\n\nOpen source software is rooted in First Amendment case law in the United States (Bernstein v. DOJ, 1999) which prioritized an individual’s right to free expression regardless of the functional nature (i.e., code) of the medium they choose. In Europe, open source is rooted in the Freedom of expression and its corollary, the freedom to write software. Open source software licenses and contribution agreements universally disclaim liability to protect this right, and many communities include explicit protections for anonymous or pseudonymous contributions (essential to enabling free speech). Any policy which imposes liability on open source software contributors, communities, or non-profits will stifle open source contributions.\n\n\nCompanies providing software for critical systems can, and should, demonstrate adherence to engineering best-practices that minimize risks and flaws. Such measurements could, in principle, be applied to open source software communities as well, however this would create financial burdens which most open source projects cannot bear.\n\n\nThe government has mechanisms to invest in and fund common infrastructure, and could apply these so that critical open source projects may reach the same safety standards applied to commercial software.\n\n\nClosing Thoughts: Regulate With Care\nToday’s solutions become tomorrow’s problems. Both of us have long valued open source collaboration on common software platforms as an effective way for humanity to advance scientifically and technologically, and for the economic opportunities that open source software creates. However, the critical role it now plays in society cannot be stewarded solely by companies, for it was not solely for-profit interests that got us here. Security issues in open source, if left solely to companies to solve, will frequently be solved first in commercial products.\nIn short, it is our view that neither regulations which utilize controls on corporate procurement nor corporate funding in open source projects (whether direct or via trade consortia) will be sufficient to achieve the result that we believe both US and EU regulators desire, namely, that open source projects, across the board, become safer to consume directly from their upstream sources.\nBy-Lines\nAeva Black is a queer and non-binary open source hacker.
