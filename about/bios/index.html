      <p>Hi! I'm Aeva Black, and you have found a page with several bios!</p>
<p>Like everyone who has such a page, this one is probably out of date already. If today is more than a year since <strong>February 13, 2022</strong>, and you came here to get a blurb for, say, a conference brochure or by-line, please <a href="../contact/">email me</a> instead and ask for something more recent.</p>
<p>If you're just looking for a headshot, please scroll to the bottom.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
