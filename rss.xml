            <title>An overdue reflection on 2020</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I try to journal around New Years every year. I&#x27;m running late this year, but with good reason - I had top surgery in December and wasn&#x27;t able to sit at my desk and comfortably write for a few weeks. By the time I could, I was swamped at work and focusing on that. Check back for a follow-up to this post when I get around to actually writing it ðŸ˜…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <title>New Site, Who Dis?</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought that migrationg to a static site generator would be a good motivation to spend more time learning Rust ... but once I compiled Rust, and compiled Zola, everything else was just a matter of getting the templating to render well and fiddling with my build-publish workflow. Oh well. I still have a new site that I&#x27;m much happier with :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s hard to believe that Iâ€™ve been at Microsoft for almost a year now â€” and that I came down with COVID-19 six and a half months ago. When I look back at the tumultuous political landscape that is 2020, these two events will doubtless color my memories of this year in ways that I can not yet really understand.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The doctors told me that it takes six to eight weeks â€“ on average â€“ for healthy folks with my symptoms to recover. It took more than six months.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You gave up everything Iâ€™ve spent my life fighting for.
I canâ€™t imagine how much you must have been hurting inside to choose to do that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <title>The Job Hunt Is Over</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s been a month now since I signed an employment contract with Microsoft.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You read that correctly â€” the giant tech company which I swore, back in the 90â€™s, I would never work for. Even though most of my colleagues have been very encouraging, even reminding me that Microsoft isnâ€™t as monopolistic or walled-off as it once was, there are still some things which bear clarification (especially for any readers that have known me during the OpenStack or MySQL days).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(content warning: gender issues and gender-based violence, no specifics but still may be difficult for some)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the Washington State Department of Licensing held a public hearing for comments on the proposed legislation to add an â€˜Xâ€™ gender marker option on state-issued IDâ€™s. I chose to go and stand up for all the non-binary, intersex, and transgender members of my communities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;A MAN IN A frock held up his right hand and said a few words, and I got to fill out some paperwork. It is strange that this process makes me feel better about myself. I abhor paperwork.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <title>What Happened To OpenStack</title>
            <pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <link>/blog/2019-what-happened-openstack/</link>
            <guid>/blog/2019-what-happened-openstack/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;The project is still quite healthy and is following the usual hype curve: OpenStack is finally mature enough that itâ€™s less interesting to talk about, so itâ€™s understandable that people think &lt;em&gt;something&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; happened.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The folks asking me this question are generally curios and good intentioned, and I think my answer says a lot about my professional background, so even during an interview I indulge in a short ramble.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, I know â€¦ I should have written about it at the time, but I had other things going on and wasnâ€™t making space in my life to write. So Iâ€™ve decided to revisit the topic today. Next time someone asks me, Iâ€™ll just point them here ðŸ˜‰&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <title>Hi, I&#x27;m queer and trans</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 28 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <link>/blog/2019-hi-queer-trans/</link>
            <guid>/blog/2019-hi-queer-trans/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Thereâ€™s something I need to get off my chest.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve used a lot of different labels to describe myself over the years â€“ geek, goth, autodidact, polyglot, kinkster, polyamorous, third-culture kid, dharma bum, database admin, software developer, cloud architect, VP. None feel as risky to claim as #trans, and yet, none of those other labels are as authentic, none require as much vulnerability to share.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
